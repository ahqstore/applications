          <p className="glitch">Void Teller: AHQ Softwares started out only as a hobby project. The developer AHQ Miness, I wonder who is he... started out with a *revolutionary* project, according to his thinking. He used to work with Scratch 4 Discord (S4D) Team. At that time, there was a project S4D Host. To put it in perspective. Our protagonist thought the method did not work out well.. and well as he did! He bootstrapped some dependencies to make the first project under the name that I think no one remembers. It started with AHQ as usual and probably was "AHQ Technologies". He also had other projects lying around at that time like the Server Helper Bot (RIP 2022) and this was a nice addition. This was with Mohineesh Sai, the first co-founder of this interim org. This became the 1st project by AHQ Softwares called "Simple Host". This project was named "Simple Host v1". It then evolved into Simple Host v2 and v3. Just like everything that had a beginning also had an end. The Simple Host project also had to end....</p>
